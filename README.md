# Tanzu App Platform - GitOps Demo Creator
![image](https://github.com/tfynes-pivotal/tap-gitops-sc/assets/6810491/cb6e38ad-57a7-4b4a-badb-03ed9d62818a)

This archive automates the deployment & configuration of an opinionated TAP cluster along with additional service operators and demonstration workloads.

Once deployed it will automatically reconcile any declared changes made to (your fork of this) gitOps repo.



It can be deployed to any kubernetes cluster on any cloud / infrastructure

## QUICK START / SETUP

### Installation Phases
  * Fork this repo
    * Update (search&replace any internal references to original repo location) (details below)
  * Download required cli tools (age, sops, ytt, git, kubectl, k9s)
  * Prepare sensitive configuration for TAP
    * Create encryption key (/clusters/taplab/sensitive-file-structures/sensitive-file-creators/1_create_age_secret.sh)
    * Create sops encrypted TAP configuration
  * Prepare non-sensitive configuration for TAP
    * Set DNS wildcard domain for cluster
    * Update any internal references in this repo to point to your fork

## Additional Implementation Details
* It uses the carvel toolchain ([tanzu cluster essentials](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-cluster-essentials)) to configure continuous reconciliation from this archive after initial deployment and configuration.
* The same configuration is used to monitor for application workload and service deployments allowing for the state of the target cluster to be driven off this repo for application deployment, lifecycle-management, upgrade, etc... as well as platform level configuration.
* Uses CertManager HTTP Solver to establish TLS based ingress platform-wide.
* Includes Tanzu Postgres Operator, allowing for declarative in-cluster postgres database provisioning for apps.
* Includes Spring Cloud Gateway Operator, allowing for declarative in-cluster micro-gateway
  * Spring Cloud Gateway routes configured to fascade demonstration applications, showing URL rewriting and API-Key based authentication support
* Tanzu Spring API-Portal enabled to provide;
  * auto-instrumentation of SpringCloudGateway routes via the operator's openapi doc endpoint
  * self-service API-Key management
* Hashicorp Vault explicitly helm deployed to provide an in-cluster backend for API-Key storage


## Prerequisites
* Compliant kubernetes cluster (GKE, AKE, EKS, TKG....)
* Image Registry (e.g. Dockerhub)
* Source Repository (e.g. Github)
* Wildcard DNS Domain (e.g. dyn.com)
* TanzuNet Credentials
* [optional] OIDC provider with account (e.g. okta developer account)

  * CLI Tooling
    * kubectl
    * k9s (optional but recommended)
    * git cli
    * ytt cli
    * yq cli
    * [age cli](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#installation)
    * [sops cli](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases)
    * tanzu cli



## Installation HowTo

### Initial Setup
1. Secrets Encryption (cluster-config/sensitive-file-structures/sensitive-file-creators)
  * Create secrets encryption key "1_create_age_secret.sh"
  * Set your dockerhub & github account details into enviroment variables
  * Populate and encrypt tap-sensitive-values.yaml "2_populate_and_encrypt_tap_sensitive_values.sh"




### Creating Sensitive-Values Configuration Files
  



* Update all configuration files to refer to your wildcard DNS domain (global search/replace)

* Create target K8s Cluster

* Deploy Tanzu Cluster Essentials

* Deploy TAP 'sync' kApp

* Update wildcard DNS entry for global ingress to cluster (based on public IP provided by cluster to Contour)
  * Monitor for IP/CNAME as follows

```
kubectl -n tanzu-system-ingress get svc -w
```

## Notes
* Installation used SOPS-encrypted (sealed-secrets) allowing for safe use of a public gitops source repository
